## Sending a PR

Your pull request should: 

* Include a clear description of the change
* Be a child commit of a reasonably-recent commit in the **master** branch 
    * Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
* (In the future:) It is desirable, but not necessary, for the tests to pass at each commit
* Have clear commit messages 
    * e.g. "Refactor feature XYZ", "Fix issue XYZ", "Add tests for issue XYZ"
* (In the future:) Include adequate tests 
    * At least one test should fail in the absence of your non-test code changes. If your PR does not match this criteria, please specify why
    * Tests should include reasonable permutations of the target fix/change
* (In the future:) Ensure there are no linting issues ("gulp tslint")
* To avoid line ending issues, set `autocrlf = input` and `whitespace = cr-at-eol` in your git configuration
